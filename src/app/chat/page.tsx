      <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Breach of Warranties</strong>: If the Seller fails to meet the warranties outlined in Schedule 3 (except for those explicitly disclosed), the Buyer can make a claim. The Seller's total liability for all warranty claims is capped at Â£25,000. The Buyer must notify the Seller of any claim within seven years of the Completion Date, following specific deadlines for different types of claims. Importantly, the Seller's liability is not limited for claims arising from dishonesty, fraud, wilful misconduct, or wilful concealment.</li>
        <li><strong>Breach of Tax Covenant</strong>: If the Seller fails to meet the tax covenant outlined in Schedule 4, the Buyer can make a claim. The Seller's liability for tax covenant claims is also capped at Â£25,000. The Buyer must notify the Seller of any claim within seven years of the Completion Date, following the same notification procedures as for warranty claims. Again, the Seller's liability is not limited for claims arising from dishonesty, fraud, wilful misconduct, or wilful concealment.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Summary of dispute clause</h3>
      <p className="mt-2">Here are the main dispute clauses identified in the legal document:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Governing Law</strong>: This agreement establishes that English law will govern all disputes arising from the agreement, including those not directly related to the contract itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>: The parties agree that the courts of England and Wales will have the authority to resolve any disagreements, meaning either party can initiate legal action in these courts.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification of Claims</strong>: The agreement emphasizes the importance of timely notification of claims, requiring the Buyer to inform the Seller of any issues within seven years of the sale's completion.</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong>: While the agreement doesn't mandate specific dispute resolution methods like mediation or arbitration, it acknowledges the possibility for the parties to agree in writing to use alternative methods, including arbitration, if they choose.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Summary of liabilities</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>: The Seller's total liability for all claims arising from the warranties and the tax covenant is capped at Â£25,000.</li>
        <li><strong>Trigger events</strong>: Claims can be made against the Seller for breaching any of the warranties listed in Schedule 3 or for breaching the tax covenant outlined in Schedule 4.</li>
        <li><strong>Procedure</strong>: The Buyer must notify the Seller in writing of any claim within seven years of the Completion Date, providing a summary of the claim and, as far as possible, an estimated amount claimed.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations</strong>: The Seller's liability is not limited for claims arising from dishonesty, fraud, wilful misconduct, or wilful concealment.</li>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Summary of confidentiality</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Confidentiality and announcements</strong>: The Seller and Buyer agree not to disclose the terms of this agreement or any confidential information relating to the Company or the Buyer to any third parties, except for their professional advisors. Neither party is allowed to make public announcements about the agreement without the other party's consent. However, the Buyer can announce the acquisition of the Sale Shares to the employees, clients, customers, or suppliers of the Company after Completion.</li>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Rating for selling conditions</h3>
      <p className="mt-2"><strong>Rating: Unfavorable ðŸ”´</strong></p>
      <p className="mt-2">The legal document appears to be unfavorable for the seller due to the limitations placed on their liability and the obligations they are required to fulfill.</p>
      <p className="mt-2">Here's a breakdown:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
        <li><strong>Price and Payment:</strong> While the purchase price is fixed, there are no provisions for early payment discounts or other favorable terms for the seller.</li>
        <li><strong>Warranties and Returns:</strong> The Seller is obligated to provide extensive warranties, which could increase their risk and potential costs, especially if there are numerous claims. Additionally, the Seller's liability is capped at Â£25,000. While this provides some protection, it might be considered a less favorable term compared to a scenario with no liability cap or a higher cap.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Completion Restrictions:</strong> The Seller is subjected to restrictions for a period of 24 months following completion, which could limit their ability to pursue other business opportunities or compete with the company. These restrictions might be considered unfavorable if they impact the Seller's future business ventures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-2">Overall, the agreement places more emphasis on protecting the Buyer's interests with warranties and limitations on the Seller's liability, and the restrictions on the Seller's post-completion activities suggest a less favorable outcome for the seller.</p>

          <p className="mt-2"><strong>Rating: Standard ðŸŸ </strong></p>
          <p className="mt-2">While the document does include some limitations on the Seller's liability (such as the Â£25,000 cap), it doesn't offer particularly favourable terms for the Buyer. However, it also doesn't contain any exceptionally unfavourable terms that would make it a "bad deal" for the Buyer.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Here's why the document is more likely to be classified as <strong>standard</strong> in terms of buying terms:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
            <li><strong>Price and Payment:</strong> The agreement doesn't specify any significant discounts or unusual payment terms. The purchase price is fixed, and payment is made in cash at completion. This is a standard practice in many share purchase agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery and Shipping:</strong> The document doesn't mention any specific shipping terms or costs, suggesting they are likely standard and negotiated separately.</li>
            <li><strong>Warranties and Returns:</strong> While there are warranties in place, they are fairly typical for this type of transaction. The Buyer has a right to make claims, but there is a cap on the Seller's liability. This is a common approach to limit risk for the Seller.</li>
            <li><strong>Service and Support:</strong> The document doesn't explicitly mention service or support terms. These are likely to be negotiated separately or handled in a separate agreement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">Overall, this agreement doesn't have any particularly unusual or unfavourable clauses that would make it a significantly "bad" deal for the Buyer. The terms appear to be fairly standard for a share purchase agreement, suggesting a typical market-based transaction.</p>
